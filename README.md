# ðŸ’¸ Expenses Tracking App

Yet another Expenses Tracking App.
I made this one for practicing more React Native layout composition, styling,
state management, global state management with the Context API and Nested Navigators.
Some new concepts I applied are: form building, form validation and visual error feedback.

## âš™ Techs used

- React
- React Native
- Expo
- React Navigation (Native Stack and Bottom Tabs)
- Axios
- Firebase

## ðŸš€ How to get up and running

1. Create a Realtime Database at Firebase
2. `git clone` this repository
3. Get the URL from Firebase, create a `.env` file with and paste the URL to a `EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_URL` variable
4. On the root folder of the project, run `npm install`
5. Then, on the root folder of the project again, run `npm run start:YOUR_OS`, changing `YOUR_OS` to either `android` or `ios`
