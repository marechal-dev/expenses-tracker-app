# ðŸ’¸ Expenses Tracking App

Yet another Expenses Tracking App.
I made this one for practicing more React Native layout composition, styling,
state management, global state management with the Context API and Nested Navigators.
Some new concepts I applied are: form building, form validation, visual error feedback.
